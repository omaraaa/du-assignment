# DU Assigment

This repo contains my implementation of Prepaid plan card component and a carousel component. The main goal of this assigment is to match the look and feel of the original PDF design + provide an interactive experience that is smooth. `src/assests/plans.json` contains mock data of prepaid plans to display. The data is used by `Carousel.vue` to generate the cards by passing the data to `Card.vue` to display each card. The Carousel is made interactive by using a custom mouse/touch scroll implementation.
